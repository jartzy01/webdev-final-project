            <h1>Why Personality Tests? </h1>
            <p>
                A personality test is completed to yield a description of an individualâ€™s distinct 
                personality traits. In most instances, your personality will influence 
                relationships with your family, friends, and classmates and contribute to your 
                health and well-being. Teachers can administer a personality test in class to 
                help your children discover their strengths and developmental needs. The 
                driving force behind administering a personality test is to open up lines of 
                communication and bring students together to have a higher appreciation for 
                one another. A personality test can provide guidance to teachers of what 
                teaching strategies will be the most effective for their students.
            </p>
            <h2>Personality test can benefit your students by:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Increasing productivity </li>
                <li>Get along better with classmates</li>
                <li>Help students realize their full potential</li>
                <li>Identify teaching strategies for students</li>
                <li>Help students appreciate other personality types</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                One of the most popular personality tests is the True Colors Personality 
                Test. This personality test asks a serious of questions to rate your likes and 
                dislikes. The test will then rate your personality as either a blue, green, orange 
                or gold personality type. You may be a combination of two colors, but usually 
                a student will exhibit one primary color. A personality test is not a means to 
                type cast a student, but it allows teachers to understand the personality 
                attributes associated with various students. You will operate as one primary 
                color for the most part, but high levels of stress and other environmental 
                factors can shift your personality type for short intervals. As a rule of 
                thumb, you should recognize your strong attributes and keep in mind the 
                attributes that irritate people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Teachers should disseminate a personality test to their children the first week 
                of school. A personality test is a fun exercise for the class and will enable 
                the teacher to more adequately plan lessons and activities for their students.
